INTRODUCTION

Climate change trends in the Arctic indicate increasing
average water temperatures. The area covered by ice is
reducing progressively, and there is evidence of boreal
species spreading up north [1]. These conditions have al-
ready shown effects in the local and surrounding ecosystems,
for example, plankton community shifts in timing, quantity,
and composition in high Arctic fjords [2].

Long-term data series of under-ice fauna are crucial
to better understand the natural and dynamic processes in
Arctic regions. One of the limiting factors for such activities
is lack of infrastructure, which makes long-term research in
these regions a very challenging task. Manned expeditions to
the Arctic ice layer are limited to remote research stations,
a few year-round observatories, and research cruises lacking
spatial resolution. Alternatively, automatic and autonomous
sensors can be used. However, they are limited by the power
and telecommunications infrastructure. This means that if
large amounts of data are gathered, they need to be manually
collected from the instrument itself.

ÅhThe Arctic Ocean ecosystems - Applied technology,
Biological interactions and Consequences in an era of abrupt
climate changeÅh  Arctic ABC1  is a project aiming to
document the under-ice Arctic ecosystem and to develop
the necessary instrumentation. The project is lead by the
University of Troms  the Arctic University of Norway
(UiT), and includes cooperation with the Norwegian Uni-
versity of Science and Technology (NTNU), the University
Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Scottish Association of

One of the milestones of Arctic ABC is to create
a set of ice-tethered platforms for optical, physical and
ecological sensors (POPEs). They are designed to perform
modern research in the Arctic [3]. The POPEs that are being
developed include: an environmental platform to measure
light and temperature in the water column, suitable for
example for ice ridge research, the Sea Ice Mass Balance
(SIMBA) [4], a platform for bio-acoustical research, and an
autonomous weather station. This paper discusses the design
and evaluation of the prototype of the bio-acoustical node,
that is equipped with a scientic echosounder (Fig. 1).

Ice drifters and buoys equipped with diverse scientic
devices have been successfully used to observe the Arctic
ecosystem [5], [6], [7]. On top of the regular considerations
needed for a marine buoy design, ice-tethered buoys face
additional challenges. These include very low temperatures
of operation, signicant variations in light regime at the
sampling site, risks of mechanical damages due to drifting
among ice structures, and the likelihood of attacks by local
fauna (e.g. polar bears). In addition,
the environmental
factors also inuence the deploying-crew effectiveness, and
safety.

The major contribution and novelty of the buoy pre-
sented in this paper is its data-retrieval mechanism. In
order to provide a relevant set of measurements, the buoyÅfs
echosounder is congured to generate amounts of data that
make it either very expensive, or almost unfeasible to be
transmitted through the satellite links publicly available
in the Arctic. Moreover,
the area of deployment makes
manual data retrieval logistically demanding and expensive
if compared to buoys in waters free of ice.

The presented system uses either a manned aircraft or
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a data-mule to collect
the observations from the buoy, as shown in [8]. The data-
mule technique involves a vehicle that ies in the proximity
of to the buoy, establishes contact with it, e.g. via radio,
and transfers data from the buoy to its on-board memory.
When the transfer is complete the aircraft travels back to a
base where the data can be collected from it. Data-muling
nodes are not limited to ying vehicles. If applicable other
platforms can be used, e.g., ships or unmanned surface
vehicles (USV), as long as they are able to come within
the radio range of the buoy.

are presented in section VII.

III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

A. Mechanics

The mechanical structure of the bio-acoustical POPE can
be divided into three parts: a housing that sits on top of the
ice, a oat, and an underwater sensor hanging under the ice
connected to the atmosphere through the instruments in the
housing above the ice.

The prototype (Fig. 1b) used an acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (ABS) pipe that acts both as a housing and a oater.
High density polyethylene (HDPE) is also being used for the
purpose as both materials continue to be robust, yet resilient
when operating at low temperatures. They are resistant to
the ultra violet rays from the sun and provide a suitable
alternative to metallic materials in this harsh environment.

The housing sits on a oater which is an APB Aqua 500
buoy (Polyform, Norway). It provides the required buoyancy
to both the housing on top and the sensor underneath it. The
sensor is attached to the buoy by means of an umbilical cable
that transfers the weight of the submerged instrument to the
top of the buoy, and includes communication and power lines
that join the buoyÅfs electronics with the sensor.

B. Underwater sensor

The POPE is designed to collect, store and transfer data
from an Autonomous Zooplankton and Fish Proler (AZFP,
ASL Environmental, Canada). The unit sends an acoustic
signal (ping) at four discrete frequencies, 38, 125, 200 and
455 kHz, and measures the returning echo. The reected
signal gives information about volume backscatter strength
(Sv), which gives a notion of abundance and depth. The type
of target, e.g. sh or zooplankton, is dened based on the
differences between the different frequencies.

The sampling program of the AZFP is optimized to
provide the highest quality of information from the habitat
specic to the Arctic over a full-year period. The sensor
pings once every 20 seconds (0.05 Hz). Data are averaged
over 5-minute periods, in 1-m vertical bins. To optimize
the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the pulse length is set to
1000 s. The maximum range is set to 500 m because SNR
decreases to unusable values (i.e. < 10dB) passed that limit.

The instrument hangs 15 m under the surface. Its di-
rectional transducers point downwards, which means that
there is a gap between the surface and the instrument
that is not insonied. However, the biological activity right
under the ice keel is of particular interest, so a second bio-
acoustical POPE is going to be deployed in the vicinity, with
the upward looking echosounder. Units will be deployed
> 500 m from each other to minimize interference in the
readings. The second AZFP will be congured with the same
ping rate and pulse lengths, however, vertical bins of 20 mm
and 25 m range.

B. Underwater sensor

The POPE is designed to collect, store and transfer data
from an Autonomous Zooplankton and Fish Proler (AZFP,
ASL Environmental, Canada). The unit sends an acoustic
signal (ping) at four discrete frequencies, 38, 125, 200 and

The units are expected to collect 1 GB of data per year
for downward looking echosounder, and 2.84 GB of data
per year for the upward looking echosounder. The internal
AZFP battery is capable of handling the proposed sampling
scheme for over a year. To transfer data from the AZFP to
the surface unit, power is supplied from a battery on the
surface housing.

C. Electronics and software

The electronic system (ES) of the buoy supports long-
term operations enabling data-collection using cutting-edge
technologies in the Arctic regions (Fig. 2). It handles three
main functions: (1) retrieves the data from underwater sensor
and copies it into the hard disk above the ice-layer, (2)
provides housekeeping information to the user, i.e. such as
GPS position, battery level, system status information, and
(3) provides access to the data using the high-speed radio-
link.

Fig. 2: Electronic System diagram. The MCU,
together
with a power board administrate the power to the individ-
ual components. These include location (GNSS), Iridium
satellite communication (SBD), sensor data-backup (SBPC),
radio (MBR), data storage (SSD), and scientic instrument
(AZFP)

The ES uses two computation units: a main control unit
(MCU), and a Single Board PC (SBPC). The MCU is a low-
energy data-logger which controls the power distribution to
all components in the buoy. It also communicates the house-
keeping information to the user via Iridium Short Burst Data
(SBD) messages, receives SBD messages send by the user,
and uses them to congure power-cycles of ES components.
To keep the system robust each component executes its
program automatically after the power is supplied. Therefore
the SBD power cycles dene how often the underwater-
sensor-data are being backed-up inside the ES memory. By
default it happens once a day when the MCU supplies power
to the SBPC. The SBPC boots into a Linux-based operating
system, executes a custom made synchronization program
that back-ups the data from the sensors, and stores it the
allocated physical memory. The program collects the full
lists of les and their sizes from the echosounder. When the
list is retrieved, the program veries that each le exists
on the internal storage, and that the size of the backup
matches the size of the original le in the echosounder.
If the le does not exist or if their sizes are different, the
backup le is downloaded again. For safety reasons no data
is being deleted at any time. Frequent data backup prevents
from complete data-loss in a situation when the sensor is

damaged, or communication is not possible, e.g. tether cut
by the ice motion.

In the presented system, the MCU role is held by a CR6
(Campbell Scientic Ltd., UK) measurement and control
datalogger. The unit is designed to operate in temperature
ranges between -40ÅãC and +70ÅãC (extended version is avail-
able). Current consumption depends on mode of operation
and scan frequency. In an idle mode it is bellow 1 mA, while
when active it takes 3 mA for 1 Hz scan, and 67 mA for
20 Hz scan.

The SBPC is TS-7250-V2 (Technologic Systems Inc.,
USA), equipped with 1 GHz ARM (Marvell PXA168) and
512 MB RAM. Its fanless operating temperature range is
-40ÅãC to 85ÅãC. Power consumption ranges from 1.00 W
to 2.58 W, typically reaching 1.21 W. Mean time between
failures (MTBF) is 2 052 852 hours. The SBPC is equipped
with an 1.92 TB SSD drive Extereme 900 (Sandisk, USA).

GPS data is acquired by the GPS16X-HVS (Garmin
Ltd., USA) receiver. It is a 12 channels satellite receiver
with the output frequency of 1 Hz, designed to operate in
temperatures between -30ÅãC and +80ÅãC. Cold acquisition
takes approximately 45 s.

Iridium communication is accessed using RockBLOCK+
(Rock Seven, UK)  based on Iridium 9602 modem, ded-
icated for M2M. It has build-in antennae, and operates in
temperatures between -40ÅãC and +85ÅãC.

IV. MODES OF OPERATION

The prototype of the buoy is fully congurable using
SBD messages. In the POPE to be deployed in the Arctic
these message are going to be extended with few more
functions. Command-masks for 5 modes of operations will
be dened in order to simplify use of the unit, see Fig. 5.
The new message format contains 8 elds:

INTRODUCTION

Climate change trends in the Arctic indicate increasing
average water temperatures. The area covered by ice is
reducing progressively, and there is evidence of boreal
species spreading up north [1]. These conditions have al-
ready shown effects in the local and surrounding ecosystems,
for example, plankton community shifts in timing, quantity,
and composition in high Arctic fjords [2].

Long-term data series of under-ice fauna are crucial
to better understand the natural and dynamic processes in
Arctic regions. One of the limiting factors for such activities
is lack of infrastructure, which makes long-term research in
these regions a very challenging task. Manned expeditions to
the Arctic ice layer are limited to remote research stations,
a few year-round observatories, and research cruises lacking
spatial resolution. Alternatively, automatic and autonomous
sensors can be used. However, they are limited by the power
and telecommunications infrastructure. This means that if
large amounts of data are gathered, they need to be manually
collected from the instrument itself.

and evaluation of the prototype of the bio-acoustical node,
that is equipped with a scientic echosounder (Fig. 1).

Ice drifters and buoys equipped with diverse scientic
devices have been successfully used to observe the Arctic
ecosystem [5], [6], [7]. On top of the regular considerations
needed for a marine buoy design, ice-tethered buoys face
additional challenges. These include very low temperatures
of operation, signicant variations in light regime at the
sampling site, risks of mechanical damages due to drifting
among ice structures, and the likelihood of attacks by local
fauna (e.g. polar bears). In addition,
the environmental
factors also inuence the deploying-crew effectiveness, and
safety.

The major contribution and novelty of the buoy pre-
sented in this paper is its data-retrieval mechanism. In
order to provide a relevant set of measurements, the buoyÅfs
echosounder is congured to generate amounts of data that
make it either very expensive, or almost unfeasible to be
transmitted through the satellite links publicly available
in the Arctic. Moreover,
the area of deployment makes
manual data retrieval logistically demanding and expensive
if compared to buoys in waters free of ice.

The presented system uses either a manned aircraft or
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a data-mule to collect
the observations from the buoy, as shown in [8]. The data-
mule technique involves a vehicle that ies in the proximity
of to the buoy, establishes contact with it, e.g. via radio,
and transfers data from the buoy to its on-board memory.
When the transfer is complete the aircraft travels back to a
base where the data can be collected from it. Data-muling
nodes are not limited to ying vehicles. If applicable other
platforms can be used, e.g., ships or unmanned surface
vehicles (USV), as long as they are able to come within
the radio range of the buoy.

III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

A. Mechanics

The mechanical structure of the bio-acoustical POPE can
be divided into three parts: a housing that sits on top of the
ice, a oat, and an underwater sensor hanging under the ice
connected to the atmosphere through the instruments in the
housing above the ice.

The prototype (Fig. 1b) used an acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (ABS) pipe that acts both as a housing and a oater.
High density polyethylene (HDPE) is also being used for the
purpose as both materials continue to be robust, yet resilient
when operating at low temperatures. They are resistant to
the ultra violet rays from the sun and provide a suitable
alternative to metallic materials in this harsh environment.

The housing sits on a oater which is an APB Aqua 500
buoy (Polyform, Norway). It provides the required buoyancy
to both the housing on top and the sensor underneath it. The
sensor is attached to the buoy by means of an umbilical cable
that transfers the weight of the submerged instrument to the
top of the buoy, and includes communication and power lines
that join the buoyÅfs electronics with the sensor.

B. Underwater sensor

The POPE is designed to collect, store and transfer data
from an Autonomous Zooplankton and Fish Proler (AZFP,
ASL Environmental, Canada). The unit sends an acoustic
signal (ping) at four discrete frequencies, 38, 125, 200 and
455 kHz, and measures the returning echo. The reected
signal gives information about volume backscatter strength
(Sv), which gives a notion of abundance and depth. The type
of target, e.g. sh or zooplankton, is dened based on the
differences between the different frequencies.

The sampling program of the AZFP is optimized to
provide the highest quality of information from the habitat
specic to the Arctic over a full-year period. The sensor
pings once every 20 seconds (0.05 Hz). Data are averaged
over 5-minute periods, in 1-m vertical bins. To optimize
the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the pulse length is set to
1000 s. The maximum range is set to 500 m because SNR
decreases to unusable values (i.e. < 10dB) passed that limit.

The instrument hangs 15 m under the surface. Its di-
rectional transducers point downwards, which means that
there is a gap between the surface and the instrument
that is not insonied. However, the biological activity right
under the ice keel is of particular interest, so a second bio-
acoustical POPE is going to be deployed in the vicinity, with
the upward looking echosounder. Units will be deployed
> 500 m from each other to minimize interference in the
readings. The second AZFP will be congured with the same
ping rate and pulse lengths, however, vertical bins of 20 mm
and 25 m range.

The units are expected to collect 1 GB of data per year
for downward looking echosounder, and 2.84 GB of data
per year for the upward looking echosounder. The internal
AZFP battery is capable of handling the proposed sampling
scheme for over a year. To transfer data from the AZFP to
the surface unit, power is supplied from a battery on the
surface housing.

C. Electronics and software

The electronic system (ES) of the buoy supports long-
term operations enabling data-collection using cutting-edge
technologies in the Arctic regions (Fig. 2). It handles three
main functions: (1) retrieves the data from underwater sensor
and copies it into the hard disk above the ice-layer, (2)
provides housekeeping information to the user, i.e. such as
GPS position, battery level, system status information, and
(3) provides access to the data using the high-speed radio-
link.

Fig. 2: Electronic System diagram. The MCU,
together
with a power board administrate the power to the individ-
ual components. These include location (GNSS), Iridium
satellite communication (SBD), sensor data-backup (SBPC),
radio (MBR), data storage (SSD), and scientic instrument
(AZFP)

The ES uses two computation units: a main control unit
(MCU), and a Single Board PC (SBPC). The MCU is a low-
energy data-logger which controls the power distribution to
all components in the buoy. It also communicates the house-
keeping information to the user via Iridium Short Burst Data
(SBD) messages, receives SBD messages send by the user,
and uses them to congure power-cycles of ES components.
To keep the system robust each component executes its
program automatically after the power is supplied. Therefore
the SBD power cycles dene how often the underwater-
sensor-data are being backed-up inside the ES memory. By
default it happens once a day when the MCU supplies power
to the SBPC. The SBPC boots into a Linux-based operating
system, executes a custom made synchronization program
that back-ups the data from the sensors, and stores it the
allocated physical memory. The program collects the full
lists of les and their sizes from the echosounder. When the
list is retrieved, the program veries that each le exists
on the internal storage, and that the size of the backup
matches the size of the original le in the echosounder.
If the le does not exist or if their sizes are different, the
backup le is downloaded again. For safety reasons no data
is being deleted at any time. Frequent data backup prevents
from complete data-loss in a situation when the sensor is

damaged, or communication is not possible, e.g. tether cut
by the ice motion.

In the presented system, the MCU role is held by a CR6
(Campbell Scientic Ltd., UK) measurement and control
datalogger. The unit is designed to operate in temperature
ranges between -40ÅãC and +70ÅãC (extended version is avail-
able). Current consumption depends on mode of operation
and scan frequency. In an idle mode it is bellow 1 mA, while
when active it takes 3 mA for 1 Hz scan, and 67 mA for
20 Hz scan.

The SBPC is TS-7250-V2 (Technologic Systems Inc.,
USA), equipped with 1 GHz ARM (Marvell PXA168) and
512 MB RAM. Its fanless operating temperature range is
-40ÅãC to 85ÅãC. Power consumption ranges from 1.00 W
to 2.58 W, typically reaching 1.21 W. Mean time between
failures (MTBF) is 2 052 852 hours. The SBPC is equipped
with an 1.92 TB SSD drive Extereme 900 (Sandisk, USA).

GPS data is acquired by the GPS16X-HVS (Garmin
Ltd., USA) receiver. It is a 12 channels satellite receiver
with the output frequency of 1 Hz, designed to operate in
temperatures between -30ÅãC and +80ÅãC. Cold acquisition
takes approximately 45 s.

Iridium communication is accessed using RockBLOCK+
(Rock Seven, UK)  based on Iridium 9602 modem, ded-
icated for M2M. It has build-in antennae, and operates in
temperatures between -40ÅãC and +85ÅãC.

IV. MODES OF OPERATION

The prototype of the buoy is fully congurable using
SBD messages. In the POPE to be deployed in the Arctic
these message are going to be extended with few more
functions. Command-masks for 5 modes of operations will
be dened in order to simplify use of the unit, see Fig. 5.

and send housekeeping data. The SBPC and AZFP are then
powered from the buoy battery and data are backed up
from the sensor to the hard disk in the housing. After the
download is nished, the AZFP goes back to sampling, and
power to SBPC, AZFP, GPS, SBD is cut-off. The AZFP
continues operation on its internal battery. The MCU goes
back into idle state. The entire process needs to be nished
within 45 minutes, otherwise a timeout will cut the power
regardless of the operation progress.

I. ABSTRACT

In this paper the authors present bio-acoustical

ice-
tethered platform for optical, physical and ecological sensors
(POPE), i.e. an ice-tethered buoy, equipped with an AZFP
scientic echosounder for sh and plankton research under
the ice in the Arctic. The POPE enables remote transfer
of large volume of environmental information using ying
vehicles as data-mules. The presented prototype has been
tested in a salt-water, open-air pool
through the winter
of 2017-2018, and the rst Arctic deployment is planned
for November 2018. This paper covers the design of the
instrument,
including details on its operation, and data-
collection mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

Climate change trends in the Arctic indicate increasing
average water temperatures. The area covered by ice is
reducing progressively, and there is evidence of boreal
species spreading up north [1]. These conditions have al-
ready shown effects in the local and surrounding ecosystems,
for example, plankton community shifts in timing, quantity,
and composition in high Arctic fjords [2].

Long-term data series of under-ice fauna are crucial
to better understand the natural and dynamic processes in
Arctic regions. One of the limiting factors for such activities
is lack of infrastructure, which makes long-term research in
these regions a very challenging task. Manned expeditions to
the Arctic ice layer are limited to remote research stations,
a few year-round observatories, and research cruises lacking
spatial resolution. Alternatively, automatic and autonomous
sensors can be used. However, they are limited by the power
and telecommunications infrastructure. This means that if
large amounts of data are gathered, they need to be manually
collected from the instrument itself.

ÅhThe Arctic Ocean ecosystems - Applied technology,
Biological interactions and Consequences in an era of abrupt
climate changeÅh  Arctic ABC1  is a project aiming to
document the under-ice Arctic ecosystem and to develop
the necessary instrumentation. The project is lead by the
University of Troms  the Arctic University of Norway
(UiT), and includes cooperation with the Norwegian Uni-
versity of Science and Technology (NTNU), the University
Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Scottish Association of
Marine Sciences (SAMS, UK).

One of the milestones of Arctic ABC is to create
a set of ice-tethered platforms for optical, physical and
ecological sensors (POPEs). They are designed to perform
modern research in the Arctic [3]. The POPEs that are being
developed include: an environmental platform to measure
light and temperature in the water column, suitable for
example for ice ridge research, the Sea Ice Mass Balance
(SIMBA) [4], a platform for bio-acoustical research, and an
autonomous weather station. This paper discusses the design
and evaluation of the prototype of the bio-acoustical node,
that is equipped with a scientic echosounder (Fig. 1).

Ice drifters and buoys equipped with diverse scientic
devices have been successfully used to observe the Arctic
ecosystem [5], [6], [7]. On top of the regular considerations
needed for a marine buoy design, ice-tethered buoys face
additional challenges. These include very low temperatures
of operation, signicant variations in light regime at the
sampling site, risks of mechanical damages due to drifting
among ice structures, and the likelihood of attacks by local
fauna (e.g. polar bears). In addition,
the environmental
factors also inuence the deploying-crew effectiveness, and
safety.

The major contribution and novelty of the buoy pre-
sented in this paper is its data-retrieval mechanism. In
order to provide a relevant set of measurements, the buoyÅfs
echosounder is congured to generate amounts of data that
make it either very expensive, or almost unfeasible to be
transmitted through the satellite links publicly available
in the Arctic. Moreover,
the area of deployment makes
manual data retrieval logistically demanding and expensive
if compared to buoys in waters free of ice.

The presented system uses either a manned aircraft or
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a data-mule to collect
the observations from the buoy, as shown in [8]. The data-
mule technique involves a vehicle that ies in the proximity
of to the buoy, establishes contact with it, e.g. via radio,
and transfers data from the buoy to its on-board memory.
When the transfer is complete the aircraft travels back to a
base where the data can be collected from it. Data-muling
nodes are not limited to ying vehicles. If applicable other
platforms can be used, e.g., ships or unmanned surface
vehicles (USV), as long as they are able to come within
the radio range of the buoy.

in the radio-range, the radio establishes connection between
SBPC and the data-mule automatically. The data-mule runs
the program that detects the presence of the POPE, and starts
retrieving data using a standard mechanism, e.g. rsync.

settings to every component, as well as interval for SBD
messages updates and checks.

5) Mode 5: Service SBPC, radio, and AZFP are powered
indenitely, or until the mode is changed by an arriving SBD
message. The MCU wakes-up GPS and Iridium every hour
to check for incoming messages and send housekeeping data.

V. POWER CONSUMPTION

The POPE is designed to be powered from a battery pack
with a nominal voltage of 15V. Power consumption varies
between modes of operation. There are 4 major tasks that
are analyzed to estimate long-term power consumption of
the buoy (Fig. 6).

Task 1 is an idle state. In this mode constant power

consumption is approximately 2 mA.

Task 2 is SBPC boot, GPS data acquisition, and SBD
messages operations. During this task average power con-
sumption increases in few steps to 202 mA, and the process
takes around 1 minute.

After SBPC is booted, the AZFP data are backed-up in
Task 3. The process takes in average 36 minutes (over a one-
year period). During that time, power consumption oscillates
around 500 mA, with peaks reaching 2 A.

Task 4 is data retrieval using data-mule. During this
task the SBPC and radio are on, and the average power
consumption is approximately 650 mA.

Direct power measurements together with the estimated
time of operation indicate that a 198 Ah @ 15 V battery
could provide enough power for 12 months of operation
with 4 data-retrieval ights.

2) booting, 3) data backup from the echosounder, and 4)
wireless transmission to a data mule, account for the power
budget of the POPE during its year-round operation.

VI. LABORATORY TESTS

In the initial phase the selected SBPC, a radio and hard-
drive were stored in the freezer set to -25Åã C for 10 days.
The system executed cycles that consisted of two phases.
In the rst phase, the power was OFF for 2 hours to let
the system cool down. In the second phase it ran for 1
hour on high-load. During these 10 days, the system went
through approximately 80 cycles. When ON, the system
was heavy loaded, generating a 1 GB set of a random data
using Linux /dev/urandom stream, which was saved on the
hard-drive. This test revealed no issues with the system,
apart from system logs lling internal memory, which was
quickly xed. A detailed check revealed no issues with the
performance of the hard drive.

The next step was a long-term outdoor test in a controlled
environment of the POPE prototype. The test started on
September 15th, 2017 and lasted until March 26th, 2017,
completing 6 months-long outdoor deployment through the
winter. The surface part stayed rst 3 months on the ground
(15.09.2017 - 14.12.2017), to experience signicant diurnal
temperature changes, followed by an equivalent period in
the water (14.12.2017  26.03.2018) experiencing lower
temperature variations, but in salty water environment. Dur-
ing the test 1152 Iridium SBD housekeeping messages
were received, however between 23.10.2017 and 7.12.2017

INTRODUCTION

Climate change trends in the Arctic indicate increasing
average water temperatures. The area covered by ice is
reducing progressively, and there is evidence of boreal
species spreading up north [1]. These conditions have al-
ready shown effects in the local and surrounding ecosystems,
for example, plankton community shifts in timing, quantity,
and composition in high Arctic fjords [2].

Long-term data series of under-ice fauna are crucial
to better understand the natural and dynamic processes in
Arctic regions. One of the limiting factors for such activities
is lack of infrastructure, which makes long-term research in
these regions a very challenging task. Manned expeditions to
the Arctic ice layer are limited to remote research stations,
a few year-round observatories, and research cruises lacking
spatial resolution. Alternatively, automatic and autonomous
sensors can be used. However, they are limited by the power
and telecommunications infrastructure. This means that if
large amounts of data are gathered, they need to be manually
collected from the instrument itself.

ÅhThe Arctic Ocean ecosystems - Applied technology,
Biological interactions and Consequences in an era of abrupt
climate changeÅh  Arctic ABC1  is a project aiming to
document the under-ice Arctic ecosystem and to develop
the necessary instrumentation. The project is lead by the
University of Troms  the Arctic University of Norway
(UiT), and includes cooperation with the Norwegian Uni-
versity of Science and Technology (NTNU), the University
Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Scottish Association of
Marine Sciences (SAMS, UK).

One of the milestones of Arctic ABC is to create
a set of ice-tethered platforms for optical, physical and
ecological sensors (POPEs). They are designed to perform
modern research in the Arctic [3]. The POPEs that are being
developed include: an environmental platform to measure
light and temperature in the water column, suitable for
example for ice ridge research, the Sea Ice Mass Balance
(SIMBA) [4], a platform for bio-acoustical research, and an
autonomous weather station. This paper discusses the design
and evaluation of the prototype of the bio-acoustical node,
that is equipped with a scientic echosounder (Fig. 1).

Ice drifters and buoys equipped with diverse scientic
devices have been successfully used to observe the Arctic
ecosystem [5], [6], [7]. On top of the regular considerations
needed for a marine buoy design, ice-tethered buoys face
additional challenges. These include very low temperatures
of operation, signicant variations in light regime at the
sampling site, risks of mechanical damages due to drifting
among ice structures, and the likelihood of attacks by local
fauna (e.g. polar bears). In addition,
the environmental
factors also inuence the deploying-crew effectiveness, and
safety.

The major contribution and novelty of the buoy pre-
sented in this paper is its data-retrieval mechanism. In
order to provide a relevant set of measurements, the buoyÅfs
echosounder is congured to generate amounts of data that
make it either very expensive, or almost unfeasible to be
transmitted through the satellite links publicly available
in the Arctic. Moreover,
the area of deployment makes
manual data retrieval logistically demanding and expensive
if compared to buoys in waters free of ice.

The presented system uses either a manned aircraft or
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a data-mule to collect
the observations from the buoy, as shown in [8]. The data-
mule technique involves a vehicle that ies in the proximity
of to the buoy, establishes contact with it, e.g. via radio,
and transfers data from the buoy to its on-board memory.
When the transfer is complete the aircraft travels back to a
base where the data can be collected from it. Data-muling
nodes are not limited to ying vehicles. If applicable other
platforms can be used, e.g., ships or unmanned surface
vehicles (USV), as long as they are able to come within
the radio range of the buoy.

the physical
layout of the bio-acoustical POPE together
with its electronics and software. Section IV describes the

III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

A. Mechanics

The mechanical structure of the bio-acoustical POPE can
be divided into three parts: a housing that sits on top of the
ice, a oat, and an underwater sensor hanging under the ice
connected to the atmosphere through the instruments in the
housing above the ice.

The prototype (Fig. 1b) used an acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (ABS) pipe that acts both as a housing and a oater.
High density polyethylene (HDPE) is also being used for the
purpose as both materials continue to be robust, yet resilient
when operating at low temperatures. They are resistant to
the ultra violet rays from the sun and provide a suitable
alternative to metallic materials in this harsh environment.

The housing sits on a oater which is an APB Aqua 500
buoy (Polyform, Norway). It provides the required buoyancy
to both the housing on top and the sensor underneath it. The
sensor is attached to the buoy by means of an umbilical cable
that transfers the weight of the submerged instrument to the
top of the buoy, and includes communication and power lines
that join the buoyÅfs electronics with the sensor.

B. Underwater sensor

The POPE is designed to collect, store and transfer data
from an Autonomous Zooplankton and Fish Proler (AZFP,
ASL Environmental, Canada). The unit sends an acoustic
signal (ping) at four discrete frequencies, 38, 125, 200 and
455 kHz, and measures the returning echo. The reected
signal gives information about volume backscatter strength
(Sv), which gives a notion of abundance and depth. The type
of target, e.g. sh or zooplankton, is dened based on the
differences between the different frequencies.

The sampling program of the AZFP is optimized to
provide the highest quality of information from the habitat
specic to the Arctic over a full-year period. The sensor
pings once every 20 seconds (0.05 Hz). Data are averaged
over 5-minute periods, in 1-m vertical bins. To optimize
the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the pulse length is set to
1000 s. The maximum range is set to 500 m because SNR
decreases to unusable values (i.e. < 10dB) passed that limit.

The instrument hangs 15 m under the surface. Its di-
rectional transducers point downwards, which means that
there is a gap between the surface and the instrument
that is not insonied. However, the biological activity right
under the ice keel is of particular interest, so a second bio-
acoustical POPE is going to be deployed in the vicinity, with
the upward looking echosounder. Units will be deployed
> 500 m from each other to minimize interference in the
readings. The second AZFP will be congured with the same
ping rate and pulse lengths, however, vertical bins of 20 mm
and 25 m range.

The units are expected to collect 1 GB of data per year
for downward looking echosounder, and 2.84 GB of data
per year for the upward looking echosounder. The internal
AZFP battery is capable of handling the proposed sampling
scheme for over a year. To transfer data from the AZFP to
the surface unit, power is supplied from a battery on the
surface housing.

C. Electronics and software

The electronic system (ES) of the buoy supports long-
term operations enabling data-collection using cutting-edge
technologies in the Arctic regions (Fig. 2). It handles three
main functions: (1) retrieves the data from underwater sensor
and copies it into the hard disk above the ice-layer, (2)
provides housekeeping information to the user, i.e. such as
GPS position, battery level, system status information, and
(3) provides access to the data using the high-speed radio-
link.

Fig. 2: Electronic System diagram. The MCU,
together
with a power board administrate the power to the individ-
ual components. These include location (GNSS), Iridium
satellite communication (SBD), sensor data-backup (SBPC),
radio (MBR), data storage (SSD), and scientic instrument
(AZFP)

The ES uses two computation units: a main control unit
(MCU), and a Single Board PC (SBPC). The MCU is a low-
energy data-logger which controls the power distribution to
all components in the buoy. It also communicates the house-
keeping information to the user via Iridium Short Burst Data
(SBD) messages, receives SBD messages send by the user,
and uses them to congure power-cycles of ES components.
To keep the system robust each component executes its
program automatically after the power is supplied. Therefore
the SBD power cycles dene how often the underwater-
sensor-data are being backed-up inside the ES memory. By
default it happens once a day when the MCU supplies power
to the SBPC. The SBPC boots into a Linux-based operating
system, executes a custom made synchronization program
that back-ups the data from the sensors, and stores it the
allocated physical memory. The program collects the full
lists of les and their sizes from the echosounder. When the
list is retrieved, the program veries that each le exists
on the internal storage, and that the size of the backup
matches the size of the original le in the echosounder.
If the le does not exist or if their sizes are different, the
backup le is downloaded again. For safety reasons no data
is being deleted at any time. Frequent data backup prevents
from complete data-loss in a situation when the sensor is

damaged, or communication is not possible, e.g. tether cut
by the ice motion.

In the presented system, the MCU role is held by a CR6
(Campbell Scientic Ltd., UK) measurement and control
datalogger. The unit is designed to operate in temperature
ranges between -40ÅãC and +70ÅãC (extended version is avail-
able). Current consumption depends on mode of operation
and scan frequency. In an idle mode it is bellow 1 mA, while
when active it takes 3 mA for 1 Hz scan, and 67 mA for
20 Hz scan.

The SBPC is TS-7250-V2 (Technologic Systems Inc.,
USA), equipped with 1 GHz ARM (Marvell PXA168) and
512 MB RAM. Its fanless operating temperature range is
-40ÅãC to 85ÅãC. Power consumption ranges from 1.00 W
to 2.58 W, typically reaching 1.21 W. Mean time between
failures (MTBF) is 2 052 852 hours. The SBPC is equipped
with an 1.92 TB SSD drive Extereme 900 (Sandisk, USA).

GPS data is acquired by the GPS16X-HVS (Garmin
Ltd., USA) receiver. It is a 12 channels satellite receiver
with the output frequency of 1 Hz, designed to operate in
temperatures between -30ÅãC and +80ÅãC. Cold acquisition
takes approximately 45 s.

Iridium communication is accessed using RockBLOCK+
(Rock Seven, UK)  based on Iridium 9602 modem, ded-
icated for M2M. It has build-in antennae, and operates in
temperatures between -40ÅãC and +85ÅãC.

IV. MODES OF OPERATION

The prototype of the buoy is fully congurable using
SBD messages. In the POPE to be deployed in the Arctic
these message are going to be extended with few more
functions. Command-masks for 5 modes of operations will
be dened in order to simplify use of the unit, see Fig. 5.
The new message format contains 8 elds:

that are received when SBD modem is on. The MCU always
follows the routine presented on Fig. 3. The software on the
SBPC is always following the same schedule, and is not
aware of current mode of operation. The SBPC routine is
presented on Fig. 4. Thanks to such approach, each power
cycle tests full functionality of the SBPC software, and
system debugging is more complete. Initial state of the MCU
(after connecting main power source) is Mode 5: Service.

1) Mode 1: Standard The AZFP is pinging using its
own battery and the sampling program described in sec-
tion III-B). The MCU is idle and the power for the rest
of the components is cut-off. The MCU wakes-up at a
predened time (rst start at TIME(UTC), repeat every
MAIN INTERVAL, see section IV). It turns on the GPS
and SBD modem in order to check for incoming messages
and send housekeeping data. The SBPC and AZFP are then
powered from the buoy battery and data are backed up
from the sensor to the hard disk in the housing. After the
download is nished, the AZFP goes back to sampling, and
power to SBPC, AZFP, GPS, SBD is cut-off. The AZFP
continues operation on its internal battery. The MCU goes
back into idle state. The entire process needs to be nished
within 45 minutes, otherwise a timeout will cut the power
regardless of the operation progress.

2) Mode 2: Pre-download The POPE expects a data-
mule to establish contact within the next 24 hours, how-
ever, the precise time-of-arrival is unknown, as it depends
on weather conditions, and the data-muling vehicle status.
The AZFP is collecting data using its own battery at the
prescheduled rate. The SBPC stays off, and no data are being
transferred from AZFP to the SBPC. The MCU wakes-up
GPS and Iridium every hour in order to check for incoming
messages and send housekeeping data.

3) Mode 3: Download The arrival time of the data-
mule is known. The MCU wakes up the SBPC and the
radio indenitely, or until
the mode is changed by an
arriving SBD message. The MCU wakes up the GPS and
Iridium every hour to check for incoming messages and
send housekeeping data. The AZFP is pinging using its own

battery at prescheduled rate. No data is being transferred
from AZFP to the SBPC. Due to lack of power on the
AZFP communication line, the SBPC cannot connect to the
AZFP and the data-backup software is stopped after 5 trials.
SBPC requests to the MCU to turn off its power and goes
to idle, however the request is ignored. When data-mule is
in the radio-range, the radio establishes connection between
SBPC and the data-mule automatically. The data-mule runs
the program that detects the presence of the POPE, and starts
retrieving data using a standard mechanism, e.g. rsync.

V. POWER CONSUMPTION

The POPE is designed to be powered from a battery pack
with a nominal voltage of 15V. Power consumption varies
between modes of operation. There are 4 major tasks that
are analyzed to estimate long-term power consumption of
the buoy (Fig. 6).

Task 1 is an idle state. In this mode constant power

consumption is approximately 2 mA.

Task 2 is SBPC boot, GPS data acquisition, and SBD

could provide enough power for 12 months of operation
with 4 data-retrieval ights.

were monitored and the curves are shown in g. 7. The
echosounder was submerged for the entire test.

VII. DATA RETRIEVAL AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
The amount of data generated by a single buoy in the
Arctic ice layer is reaching the point where an alternative
to satellite communication is necessary. That is caused by a
set of factors such as energy consumption, available transfer
speed, and costs of satellite use.

In the presented approach, the authors plan to utilize
ying vehicles to retrieve the data from the POPE, based
on their previous experience from [9], [8]. A set of mile-
stones have been set. In the early phase a Dornier Do-228
(Lufttransport AS, Norway) equipped with a special pod2
that includes an advanced maritime radio system will reach
the buoy and collect its data. At the same time, research is
being conducted with the goal to reach the POPE using an
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with similar type
of radio-payload.

The data retrieval process is similar for both manned
airplane and UAV. When the data-retrieval mission start, the
buoy will be set to predownload mode of operation, waiting
for information about exact plane arrival time. When the
time is determined the buoy will be commanded to enter the
download mode. As the plane approaches the node, the radio
will establish communication, and a computer on-board the
aircraft will start data collection process using, e.g. rsync
software. When the full data set is received the buoy will be
set to standard mode of operation using SBD message, and
the plane will return to base with the scientic observations
gathered by the underwater instrument.

The expected transfer rate depends on the radio technol-
ogy used. For the rst iteration, the Maritime Broadband
Radio (MBR, Kongsberg, Norway) was selected. At the
current stage of development, an asymmetric link is expected

2http://norut.no/en/news/verdens-forste-passasjery-miljoovervaking-er-

norsk

to provide an average transfer speed of approximately 13-
14.5 Mbps from the buoys to the plane. That should allow
to download 4 GB (full set of yearly data, 1 + 3 GB) from
2 buoys in roughly 35 minutes.

The buoy will start its Arctic operation in November
2018, and its data-retrieval process using a ying data-mule
is expected to be tested in early 2019. Further development
of the radio technology, as well as improvements to the data-
muling process, should allow multi-gigabytes, unmanned
data-retrieval campaigns in the Arctic regions within the next
years.

The development of the bio-acoustical POPE will con-
tinue after the rst deployment. The next generation of the
bio-acoustical POPE is intended to collect data using a
wideband echosounder. Preliminary analysis of data from
this instrument shows that a yearly data set is likely to
exceed 100 GB, which is a major consideration when
evaluating data transport methods. That is also one of the
main motivation factors for further development of data-
muling UAVs.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper the design of the Arctic ABC bio-acoustical
POPE was presented. This ice-tethered buoy with a scientic
echosounder is going to collect ecological information on the
distribution of sh and plankton in the water column under
the Arctic ice layer for a period of at least one year.

The POPE is physically divided into a housing that
contains the electronic systems, a oat and an AZFP as its
scientic instrument. It operates in ve different modes that
optimize the use of the embedded battery power and provide
remote and wireless communication with its user.

The amount of data generated by the AZFP through its
deployment justies the use of ying data-mules instead of
satellite links available in the Arctic. The rst deployment
of the buoy is planned for November 2018.

the necessary instrumentation. The project is lead by the
University of Troms  the Arctic University of Norway
(UiT), and includes cooperation with the Norwegian Uni-
versity of Science and Technology (NTNU), the University
Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Scottish Association of
Marine Sciences (SAMS, UK).

One of the milestones of Arctic ABC is to create
a set of ice-tethered platforms for optical, physical and
ecological sensors (POPEs). They are designed to perform
modern research in the Arctic [3]. The POPEs that are being
developed include: an environmental platform to measure
light and temperature in the water column, suitable for
example for ice ridge research, the Sea Ice Mass Balance
(SIMBA) [4], a platform for bio-acoustical research, and an
autonomous weather station. This paper discusses the design
and evaluation of the prototype of the bio-acoustical node,
that is equipped with a scientic echosounder (Fig. 1).

Ice drifters and buoys equipped with diverse scientic
devices have been successfully used to observe the Arctic
ecosystem [5], [6], [7]. On top of the regular considerations
needed for a marine buoy design, ice-tethered buoys face
additional challenges. These include very low temperatures
of operation, signicant variations in light regime at the
sampling site, risks of mechanical damages due to drifting
among ice structures, and the likelihood of attacks by local
fauna (e.g. polar bears). In addition,
the environmental
factors also inuence the deploying-crew effectiveness, and
safety.

The major contribution and novelty of the buoy pre-
sented in this paper is its data-retrieval mechanism. In
order to provide a relevant set of measurements, the buoyÅfs
echosounder is congured to generate amounts of data that
make it either very expensive, or almost unfeasible to be
transmitted through the satellite links publicly available
in the Arctic. Moreover,
the area of deployment makes
manual data retrieval logistically demanding and expensive
if compared to buoys in waters free of ice.

The presented system uses either a manned aircraft or
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a data-mule to collect
the observations from the buoy, as shown in [8]. The data-
mule technique involves a vehicle that ies in the proximity
of to the buoy, establishes contact with it, e.g. via radio,
and transfers data from the buoy to its on-board memory.
When the transfer is complete the aircraft travels back to a
base where the data can be collected from it. Data-muling
nodes are not limited to ying vehicles. If applicable other
platforms can be used, e.g., ships or unmanned surface
vehicles (USV), as long as they are able to come within
the radio range of the buoy.

the physical
layout of the bio-acoustical POPE together

III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

A. Mechanics

The mechanical structure of the bio-acoustical POPE can
be divided into three parts: a housing that sits on top of the
ice, a oat, and an underwater sensor hanging under the ice
connected to the atmosphere through the instruments in the
housing above the ice.

The prototype (Fig. 1b) used an acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (ABS) pipe that acts both as a housing and a oater.
High density polyethylene (HDPE) is also being used for the
purpose as both materials continue to be robust, yet resilient
when operating at low temperatures. They are resistant to
the ultra violet rays from the sun and provide a suitable
alternative to metallic materials in this harsh environment.

The housing sits on a oater which is an APB Aqua 500
buoy (Polyform, Norway). It provides the required buoyancy
to both the housing on top and the sensor underneath it. The
sensor is attached to the buoy by means of an umbilical cable
that transfers the weight of the submerged instrument to the
top of the buoy, and includes communication and power lines
that join the buoyÅfs electronics with the sensor.

B. Underwater sensor

The POPE is designed to collect, store and transfer data
from an Autonomous Zooplankton and Fish Proler (AZFP,
ASL Environmental, Canada). The unit sends an acoustic
signal (ping) at four discrete frequencies, 38, 125, 200 and
455 kHz, and measures the returning echo. The reected
signal gives information about volume backscatter strength
(Sv), which gives a notion of abundance and depth. The type
of target, e.g. sh or zooplankton, is dened based on the
differences between the different frequencies.

The sampling program of the AZFP is optimized to
provide the highest quality of information from the habitat
specic to the Arctic over a full-year period. The sensor
pings once every 20 seconds (0.05 Hz). Data are averaged
over 5-minute periods, in 1-m vertical bins. To optimize
the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the pulse length is set to
1000 s. The maximum range is set to 500 m because SNR
decreases to unusable values (i.e. < 10dB) passed that limit.

The instrument hangs 15 m under the surface. Its di-
rectional transducers point downwards, which means that
there is a gap between the surface and the instrument
that is not insonied. However, the biological activity right
under the ice keel is of particular interest, so a second bio-
acoustical POPE is going to be deployed in the vicinity, with
the upward looking echosounder. Units will be deployed
> 500 m from each other to minimize interference in the
readings. The second AZFP will be congured with the same
ping rate and pulse lengths, however, vertical bins of 20 mm
and 25 m range.

The units are expected to collect 1 GB of data per year
for downward looking echosounder, and 2.84 GB of data
per year for the upward looking echosounder. The internal
AZFP battery is capable of handling the proposed sampling
scheme for over a year. To transfer data from the AZFP to
the surface unit, power is supplied from a battery on the
surface housing.

C. Electronics and software

The electronic system (ES) of the buoy supports long-
term operations enabling data-collection using cutting-edge
technologies in the Arctic regions (Fig. 2). It handles three
main functions: (1) retrieves the data from underwater sensor
and copies it into the hard disk above the ice-layer, (2)
provides housekeeping information to the user, i.e. such as
GPS position, battery level, system status information, and
(3) provides access to the data using the high-speed radio-
link.

Fig. 2: Electronic System diagram. The MCU,
together
with a power board administrate the power to the individ-
ual components. These include location (GNSS), Iridium
satellite communication (SBD), sensor data-backup (SBPC),
radio (MBR), data storage (SSD), and scientic instrument
(AZFP)

The ES uses two computation units: a main control unit
(MCU), and a Single Board PC (SBPC). The MCU is a low-
energy data-logger which controls the power distribution to
all components in the buoy. It also communicates the house-
keeping information to the user via Iridium Short Burst Data
(SBD) messages, receives SBD messages send by the user,
and uses them to congure power-cycles of ES components.
To keep the system robust each component executes its
program automatically after the power is supplied. Therefore
the SBD power cycles dene how often the underwater-
sensor-data are being backed-up inside the ES memory. By
default it happens once a day when the MCU supplies power
to the SBPC. The SBPC boots into a Linux-based operating
system, executes a custom made synchronization program
that back-ups the data from the sensors, and stores it the
allocated physical memory. The program collects the full
lists of les and their sizes from the echosounder. When the
list is retrieved, the program veries that each le exists
on the internal storage, and that the size of the backup
matches the size of the original le in the echosounder.
If the le does not exist or if their sizes are different, the
backup le is downloaded again. For safety reasons no data
is being deleted at any time. Frequent data backup prevents
from complete data-loss in a situation when the sensor is

damaged, or communication is not possible, e.g. tether cut
by the ice motion.

In the presented system, the MCU role is held by a CR6
(Campbell Scientic Ltd., UK) measurement and control
datalogger. The unit is designed to operate in temperature
ranges between -40ÅãC and +70ÅãC (extended version is avail-
able). Current consumption depends on mode of operation
and scan frequency. In an idle mode it is bellow 1 mA, while
when active it takes 3 mA for 1 Hz scan, and 67 mA for
20 Hz scan.

The SBPC is TS-7250-V2 (Technologic Systems Inc.,
USA), equipped with 1 GHz ARM (Marvell PXA168) and
512 MB RAM. Its fanless operating temperature range is
-40ÅãC to 85ÅãC. Power consumption ranges from 1.00 W
to 2.58 W, typically reaching 1.21 W. Mean time between
failures (MTBF) is 2 052 852 hours. The SBPC is equipped
with an 1.92 TB SSD drive Extereme 900 (Sandisk, USA).

GPS data is acquired by the GPS16X-HVS (Garmin
Ltd., USA) receiver. It is a 12 channels satellite receiver
with the output frequency of 1 Hz, designed to operate in
temperatures between -30ÅãC and +80ÅãC. Cold acquisition
takes approximately 45 s.

Iridium communication is accessed using RockBLOCK+
(Rock Seven, UK)  based on Iridium 9602 modem, ded-
icated for M2M. It has build-in antennae, and operates in
temperatures between -40ÅãC and +85ÅãC.

IV. MODES OF OPERATION

The prototype of the buoy is fully congurable using
SBD messages. In the POPE to be deployed in the Arctic
these message are going to be extended with few more
functions. Command-masks for 5 modes of operations will
be dened in order to simplify use of the unit, see Fig. 5.
The new message format contains 8 elds:

that are received when SBD modem is on. The MCU always
follows the routine presented on Fig. 3. The software on the
SBPC is always following the same schedule, and is not
aware of current mode of operation. The SBPC routine is
presented on Fig. 4. Thanks to such approach, each power
cycle tests full functionality of the SBPC software, and
system debugging is more complete. Initial state of the MCU
(after connecting main power source) is Mode 5: Service.

1) Mode 1: Standard The AZFP is pinging using its
own battery and the sampling program described in sec-
tion III-B). The MCU is idle and the power for the rest
of the components is cut-off. The MCU wakes-up at a
predened time (rst start at TIME(UTC), repeat every
MAIN INTERVAL, see section IV). It turns on the GPS
and SBD modem in order to check for incoming messages
and send housekeeping data. The SBPC and AZFP are then
powered from the buoy battery and data are backed up
from the sensor to the hard disk in the housing. After the
download is nished, the AZFP goes back to sampling, and
power to SBPC, AZFP, GPS, SBD is cut-off. The AZFP
continues operation on its internal battery. The MCU goes
back into idle state. The entire process needs to be nished
within 45 minutes, otherwise a timeout will cut the power
regardless of the operation progress.

2) Mode 2: Pre-download The POPE expects a data-
mule to establish contact within the next 24 hours, how-
ever, the precise time-of-arrival is unknown, as it depends
on weather conditions, and the data-muling vehicle status.
The AZFP is collecting data using its own battery at the
prescheduled rate. The SBPC stays off, and no data are being
transferred from AZFP to the SBPC. The MCU wakes-up
GPS and Iridium every hour in order to check for incoming
messages and send housekeeping data.

3) Mode 3: Download The arrival time of the data-
mule is known. The MCU wakes up the SBPC and the
radio indenitely, or until
the mode is changed by an
arriving SBD message. The MCU wakes up the GPS and
Iridium every hour to check for incoming messages and
send housekeeping data. The AZFP is pinging using its own

will not be cut-off.

The 5 predened modes can be activated by messages

Fig. 5: The 5 modes of operation of the bio-acoustical POPE allow environmental information to be gathered, backed up,
and transmitted wirelessly while optimizing the use of the battery. They also allow the POPE to be remotely congured by

battery at prescheduled rate. No data is being transferred
from AZFP to the SBPC. Due to lack of power on the
AZFP communication line, the SBPC cannot connect to the
AZFP and the data-backup software is stopped after 5 trials.
SBPC requests to the MCU to turn off its power and goes
to idle, however the request is ignored. When data-mule is
in the radio-range, the radio establishes connection between
SBPC and the data-mule automatically. The data-mule runs
the program that detects the presence of the POPE, and starts
retrieving data using a standard mechanism, e.g. rsync.

4) Mode 4: Debug Enables to apply custom power
settings to every component, as well as interval for SBD
messages updates and checks.

5) Mode 5: Service SBPC, radio, and AZFP are powered
indenitely, or until the mode is changed by an arriving SBD
message. The MCU wakes-up GPS and Iridium every hour
to check for incoming messages and send housekeeping data.

V. POWER CONSUMPTION

The POPE is designed to be powered from a battery pack
with a nominal voltage of 15V. Power consumption varies
between modes of operation. There are 4 major tasks that
are analyzed to estimate long-term power consumption of
the buoy (Fig. 6).

Task 1 is an idle state. In this mode constant power

consumption is approximately 2 mA.

Task 2 is SBPC boot, GPS data acquisition, and SBD
messages operations. During this task average power con-
sumption increases in few steps to 202 mA, and the process
takes around 1 minute.

After SBPC is booted, the AZFP data are backed-up in
Task 3. The process takes in average 36 minutes (over a one-
year period). During that time, power consumption oscillates
around 500 mA, with peaks reaching 2 A.

Task 4 is data retrieval using data-mule. During this
task the SBPC and radio are on, and the average power
consumption is approximately 650 mA.

Direct power measurements together with the estimated
time of operation indicate that a 198 Ah @ 15 V battery
could provide enough power for 12 months of operation
with 4 data-retrieval ights.

Fig. 6: Power consumption. Four different tasks, 1) idle,
2) booting, 3) data backup from the echosounder, and 4)
wireless transmission to a data mule, account for the power
budget of the POPE during its year-round operation.

VI. LABORATORY TESTS

In the initial phase the selected SBPC, a radio and hard-
drive were stored in the freezer set to -25Åã C for 10 days.
The system executed cycles that consisted of two phases.
In the rst phase, the power was OFF for 2 hours to let
the system cool down. In the second phase it ran for 1
hour on high-load. During these 10 days, the system went
through approximately 80 cycles. When ON, the system
was heavy loaded, generating a 1 GB set of a random data
using Linux /dev/urandom stream, which was saved on the
hard-drive. This test revealed no issues with the system,
apart from system logs lling internal memory, which was
quickly xed. A detailed check revealed no issues with the
performance of the hard drive.

The next step was a long-term outdoor test in a controlled
environment of the POPE prototype. The test started on
September 15th, 2017 and lasted until March 26th, 2017,
completing 6 months-long outdoor deployment through the
winter. The surface part stayed rst 3 months on the ground
(15.09.2017 - 14.12.2017), to experience signicant diurnal
temperature changes, followed by an equivalent period in
the water (14.12.2017  26.03.2018) experiencing lower
temperature variations, but in salty water environment. Dur-
ing the test 1152 Iridium SBD housekeeping messages
were received, however between 23.10.2017 and 7.12.2017
the Iridium modem was temporarily deactivated. When the
Iridium modem was active the temperature and battery status

were monitored and the curves are shown in g. 7. The
echosounder was submerged for the entire test.

VII. DATA RETRIEVAL AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
The amount of data generated by a single buoy in the
Arctic ice layer is reaching the point where an alternative
to satellite communication is necessary. That is caused by a
set of factors such as energy consumption, available transfer
speed, and costs of satellite use.

In the presented approach, the authors plan to utilize
ying vehicles to retrieve the data from the POPE, based
on their previous experience from [9], [8]. A set of mile-
stones have been set. In the early phase a Dornier Do-228
(Lufttransport AS, Norway) equipped with a special pod2
that includes an advanced maritime radio system will reach
the buoy and collect its data. At the same time, research is
being conducted with the goal to reach the POPE using an
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with similar type
of radio-payload.

The data retrieval process is similar for both manned
airplane and UAV. When the data-retrieval mission start, the
buoy will be set to predownload mode of operation, waiting
for information about exact plane arrival time. When the
time is determined the buoy will be commanded to enter the
download mode. As the plane approaches the node, the radio
will establish communication, and a computer on-board the
aircraft will start data collection process using, e.g. rsync
software. When the full data set is received the buoy will be
set to standard mode of operation using SBD message, and
the plane will return to base with the scientic observations
gathered by the underwater instrument.

The expected transfer rate depends on the radio technol-
ogy used. For the rst iteration, the Maritime Broadband
Radio (MBR, Kongsberg, Norway) was selected. At the
current stage of development, an asymmetric link is expected

2http://norut.no/en/news/verdens-forste-passasjery-miljoovervaking-er-

norsk

to provide an average transfer speed of approximately 13-
14.5 Mbps from the buoys to the plane. That should allow
to download 4 GB (full set of yearly data, 1 + 3 GB) from
2 buoys in roughly 35 minutes.

The buoy will start its Arctic operation in November
2018, and its data-retrieval process using a ying data-mule
is expected to be tested in early 2019. Further development
of the radio technology, as well as improvements to the data-
muling process, should allow multi-gigabytes, unmanned
data-retrieval campaigns in the Arctic regions within the next
years.

The development of the bio-acoustical POPE will con-
tinue after the rst deployment. The next generation of the
bio-acoustical POPE is intended to collect data using a
wideband echosounder. Preliminary analysis of data from
this instrument shows that a yearly data set is likely to
exceed 100 GB, which is a major consideration when
evaluating data transport methods. That is also one of the
main motivation factors for further development of data-
muling UAVs.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper the design of the Arctic ABC bio-acoustical
POPE was presented. This ice-tethered buoy with a scientic
echosounder is going to collect ecological information on the
distribution of sh and plankton in the water column under
the Arctic ice layer for a period of at least one year.

The POPE is physically divided into a housing that
contains the electronic systems, a oat and an AZFP as its
scientic instrument. It operates in ve different modes that
optimize the use of the embedded battery power and provide
remote and wireless communication with its user.

The amount of data generated by the AZFP through its
deployment justies the use of ying data-mules instead of
satellite links available in the Arctic. The rst deployment
of the buoy is planned for November 2018.
